# user-auth
express, handlebars, sqlite, passport, foundation


### permission levels
- user
- editor
  - add/edit images in gallery
  - add/edit documents
- admin
  - all lower permissions, add/edit users


### deployment
- `npm install` to install node dependencies
- `gulp` to build stylesheets
  - if developing, you can run `gulp dev` and it will watch for changes and rebuild it changes are detected
- need postgres running
- change the permissions of the db, backups and tmp folders so the app can write to it, e.g. `sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /ttl-viz/db/` `sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /ttl-viz/backups/` and `sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /ttl-viz/tmp/` (there are better user management practices for your server)
- after running ` sudo node app.js` once to generate the sqlite db files you can change permission to make those writeable and then shouldn't have to run the app using sudo again, eg. `sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /ttl-viz/db/sessions.db` and `sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /ttl-viz/db/site.db`
- adjust commented out `var` on lines 66-69 in `routes/postGresRefresh.js`
- create `settings.js` file from `settings.js.example` and adjust settings for your deployment
- run the webpage using `node app.js`
- use PM2 or something similar to keep the app up and running
