		<p>November 8, 2013 – the day that Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), the strongest typhoon ever to make landfall, hit the Philippines and impacted the lives of 14 million people. The typhoon had a widespread effect, covering 14 provinces and 171 municipalities, where scores of homes were damaged or destroyed, various livelihoods disrupted, numerous crops were lost, and sanitation systems were affected.</p>
		<p>In response to this disaster, the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) in partnership with American Red Cross (ARC) implemented a 3-year recovery project, which spans from July 2014 to June 2017. The project covers 4 municipalities and 23 barangays, and comprises activities in the core sectors of Shelter and Settlement, Livelihoods, Sanitation, Health, and Disaster Risk Reduction.</p>
		<p>The main goal of the project is to contribute to building safe and resilient communities by identifying and addressing various factors that will help people sustainably rebuild their lives, livelihoods, and assets while ensuring that future climate, environmental and disaster related risks are addressed and/or minimized.</p>
