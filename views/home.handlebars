		<p>Kif might! Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Also Zoidberg. Meh. I just told you! You've killed me! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.</p>
		<p>Hey, whatcha watching? I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Guess again. And then the battle's not so bad? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</p>
		<p>Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
		<p>I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</p>

		<p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Kif might! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Who am I making this out to?</p>

But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</p>

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution.
